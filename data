Configuration Management
============================
This is the process of configuring servers from one point
of control

Advantages
==================
1 Provisioning of Servers
  Setup of s/w's on servers can be done very easily from one point

2 Reduction of usage of resources
  We require less amount of time,money and human resources to configure
  servers

3 Handling Snowflake servers
  After a point of time all servers in the data center behave like
  snowflake servers ie they might be running on slightly different
  h/w and s/w confurations.Configuaration Management tools can pick
  up this info in simple setup file which can be reused to setup
  similar environments
